# My New Portfolio

I have updated my new portfolio from my old one with the new technologies I have learned.

 [Old Portfolio Demo](https://torqie.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/) 
 
 [New Portfolio Demo](https://torqie.github.io/new-portfolio/)

This is a single page, as you click the links it smooths scrools to the disired "page" if you scroll by your self as your enter into the next "page" it will change the active link on the navigation.

### Things I would like to add
Right now the projects are just stored in an object. Eventually I will be moving these projects to a database with the abality to add a new project to my site from the web interface.
