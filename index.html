                    I have worked in the oil field for the past 14 years, coding whenever I had the chance.
                    I have self taught with tutorials and screencasts a varity of languages including HTML, CSS,
                    PHP (Laravel), JS, Jquery and VueJS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dream job is to either work remotely with a company or become a freelance developer. I have worked
                    close to 100 hours a week for the past 14 years; I am ready to spend some time with my family while still
                    doing what I love... Coding!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always had a passion for web development since I worked at intel shortly after highschool.
                    Before begining to teach myself coding, I was very active and designing websites with photoshop for other
                    people. Now I enjoy taking the "pretty picture" and making it work in website form.
                </p>

                    In my free time I love being out on the water boating enjoying all that the lake has to offer.
